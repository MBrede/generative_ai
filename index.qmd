This script serves as an introduction to **Generative AI** and was developed for the elective module "Generative AI," offered to master's students of the "Data Science" program at the University of Applied Sciences Kiel. Built using `quarto`, this resource is designed to provide an accessible overview of key topics and applications in this rapidly evolving field.

While not an exhaustive guide to Generative AI, the script highlights foundational concepts, modern applications, and practical techniques that empower students to engage with and explore the possibilities of these transformative technologies.
