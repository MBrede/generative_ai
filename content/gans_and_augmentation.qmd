# AI image generation II {#sec-GANS}

## Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN)

"The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters,
trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is
analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives
both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine
articles."

- architechture: generator, discriminator, see quote above
- game theory, math
- convolutions, deconvolutions
- latent space, noise

problems (challenges)

- unstable -> start small (e.g. 4x4), then grow larger
- mode collapse (helvetica scenario) when generator better than discriminator -> half-solution (overtrain discriminator) two time-scale update rule (TTUR), 
- Vanishing gradient when discriminator better than generator
