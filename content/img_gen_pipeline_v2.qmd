# AI image generation pipelines

## motivation

- überleitung vom letzten mal

- we need to run it in a pipeline

## Basics of using Open Source AI image generation models



<!-- 
motivation: use it easily and comfortably on local device comparable to ollama, lmstudio for LLMs. Tools for this include

- automatic1111's open web ui (not maintained anymore)
- comfy ui (sehr mächtig, low code)
- huggingface, see last session

task: 

- try one or more of these tools
- try generation parameters (maybe with more input from lecturer? mention them before in main text. or make this a second task. )
- try loading another img gen model

We want API mode, explain API mode, basically call from python

task: if using some ui (not on hugging face) try api mode

## AI image generators in agent systems or pipelines

<!-- 
thoughts: first full pipeline and then motivate singe steps? or step by step motivation?

motivation: the project, include image gen in a agent system or pipeline. we want to generate illustrations for our text. so pipeline needs to work on generic text input, not specialized image prompts. pipeline:

- generic text block, e.g. generated, the text from text gen pipeline or other
- image prompt generation
- image generation
- quality assurance

how would we do it?

- example: just use some text and try to generate an image (either only gedankenexperiment, but better to try this, i.e. the corgi wikipedia header text)
- example: generate an image prompt first. is it better? should be (can only handle short descriptions based on its training, also text is not normally good image prompt)
