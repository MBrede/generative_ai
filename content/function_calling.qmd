# Towards Agents: chatbots and function calling

## Chatbots

So far, we covered connecting with a local LLM and getting a single response. We also discussed the difference between base models and instruct-tuned models. On thing though is still missing, especially if you want to have something resembling a meaningful conversation with the LLM. 

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Task

Let's talk!

1. Open a notebook and connect to a local LLM using LM Studio.
2. Tell the LLM something about you.
3. In a second call, ask the LLM what you just told it. It should know, right? You just told it.

### Simple LLM call

This is my simple example. The wrapper class is, of course, not strictly necessary.


```python
from openai import OpenAI

class LLMCall():
    
    def __init__(self, client, model, system_message = "You are a helpful AI agent.", temperature = 0.7):
        self.client = client
        self.model = model
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.system_message = system_message
        
    
    def simple_call(self, message):
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model = self.model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": f"{self.system_message}"},
                {"role": "user", "content": message}
            ],
            temperature=self.temperature
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="lm-studio")

llm_assistent = LLMCall(client=client, model="meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct")

```

```python
llm_assistent.simple_call("Please remember that i really like potatoes")
```

    "A potato enthusiast! I'll make sure to keep that in mind as we chat. Do you have a favorite way of preparing or using potatoes? Are you more into baked, mashed, roasted, or maybe something else entirely? Let me know and I can try to suggest some delicious ideas for you."

```python
llm_assistent.simple_call("what food item do i like to eat?")
```
    "I'm happy to help you, but I don't have any prior knowledge about your preferences or eating habits. However, I can try to make an educated guess.\n\nCan you give me some hints or clues about the type of cuisine or food item that you enjoy? For example:\n\n- Do you like sweet treats or savory dishes?\n- Are you a meat-lover or do you prefer plant-based options?\n- Do you have a favorite continent or country's cuisine (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Mexican)?\n- Is there a particular texture or consistency you prefer (e.g. crunchy, soft, chewy)?\n\nLet me know and I can try to suggest some possibilities!"
:::

As you have seen, the LLM cannot remember what we just told it. In technical terms, we say the LLM is stateless. To emphasize this: this is not what most people expect. It clearly is not how conversations with people work, it is also not how conversations with popular chatbots (i.e. chatgpt or claude) usually go. So, what is missing, here?

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Task

We should have a conversation.

1. In your notebook, write a chat function or method that does the following:
    - saves the conversation history.
    - adds the user' message to the history.
    - sends the system message plus conversation to the LLM.
    - adds the response to the history

2. Test the chat function as above.
3. Can you see any downsides of this approach? What about long conversations?
4. (Optional) Implement a limit to the conversation length. Make sure the system message is always read. 

3. Upload your results to Moodle.
:::

Congratulations! You just build yourself a chatbot. 

Here are this section's take home messages:

1. A single LLM call is stateless—it has no memory of previous interactions. Each request is independent. 
2. To enable multi-turn conversations, we need to
    - Store the conversation history (user and assistant messages).
    - Send the full history with each new request. (As long as it fits within the context window.)



## Function Calling

### Motivation


Sometimes you want your AI assistant to answer more complex tasks then the LLM can handle out of the box. For example, you might want to ask questions regarding documents or datasets on your hard drive, or ask about recent events. This is a hard task for an LLM, because, if it was not trained on this information, i.e. the information wasn't part of its training data, it won't be able to answer these questions correctly. 

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Task

Try it!

1. Open a notebook and connect to a local LLM using LM Studio.
2. Ask the LLM about the current weather in your location.

(I mean, sure, you could just look out the window, but we are developers here, we don't have windows!)

:::


To solve this problem, we need to give the LLM assistant some tools it can use to access this additional information. This is where **function calling** comes into play. Function calling allows the assistant to call a function with specific parameters to get the required information. The function then returns the requested data or performs the necessary task, and the LLM can continue generating its response based on that information.

This is what we call an LLM agent or agent system. We will look deeper into agents (and alternatives) soon. For now, we will just say that we have an *agent system* or that a system is *agentic* if the system has access to tools or functions and if the LLM decides which tools to use and when (or if). 


A basic agentic workflow may look like this: 

1. The user inputs a question or task.
2. The LLM determines if it needs additional information or assistance from external tools.
3. If needed, the LLM calls a function with specific parameters to retrieve the required data or perform the necessary task. This means the LLM generates an answer containing either some executable code or a JSON object containing the name of the function and its parameters. These functions have to be defined in advance. 
4. The LLM response is then scanned for these elements (code or JSON object) and these are executed if possible.
5. The response is then fed back into the LLM (usually as user input) for further processing. 
6. The LLM uses the returned information to continue generating its response.

We obviously need the conversation history from earlier for this to work. We also need to give the system access to the functions.

**Note:** As stated above, the functions need to be predefined. In theory, we could just give the LLM its task and let it generate code to be executed. This is, however not the best idea for reasons of security. 

<!-- ## Code generation and function calling -->

<!-- The basic idea of function calling is to use an LLM to generate valid, executable code from the user input. That is, the user's input is sent to the LLM, together with a prompt, urging it to return structured output in a specific format. This output can then be taken and executed. For this to work properly, of course, the generated output *must* be valid code (in our case python code). There are two approaches for that: -->

There are two main ways to implement function calling:

1. **Structured output**: Here, the LLM is tasked to generate a tool call in the form of a JSON object containing the name of the function and its parameters. 
2. **Code generation**: Here, we ask the LLM to generate the function calls in the form of executable python code. Usually, we still want to restrict the LLM to use only predefined functions. Nevertheless, this can pose a severe security issue because this approach hinges on running generated code on your machine. 
<!-- Here, we ask the LLM to generate a complete python script from the user input. This approach has the advantage of being simple and straightforward, but it can be prone to errors if the LLM does not fully understand the task at hand or if it makes mistakes in its code generation. It can also pose a severe security issue because this approach hinges on running generated code on your machine.  -->
<!-- 2. **Function calling**: Here, we ask the LLM to generate a function call from the user input. This approach has the advantage of being more robust and accurate than code generation, as it is easier for the LLM to generate a correct function call than a complete python script. However, it requires that the functions that can be called are already defined and that they are properly documented. -->

<!-- Here, we will focus on function calling.  -->

<!-- Still the challenge is to get the LLM to generate valid output. There are two main strategies to facilitate that:

1. using a large, generalized LLM (e.g. GPT-4) with good prompt engineering and
2. using a smaller model fine tuned to generate function calls. -->

Today, we will not implement the full agentic workflow outlined above. We will get there eventually, though. Here, we want to focus on step 3, the function call. The aim is to take a user request and translate it into structured output, either JSON or code. In the following, we will explore how to do it. 



### Structured output

<!-- some smart sentences -->

The traditional way^[In this context, *traditional* means: people have been using it for more than a year. ] of doing function calling is to generate a JSON object containing the name of the function and its parameters. Until recently, all major agent frameworks (more on agents next time) used this approach. Here, the LLM response is scanned for a JSON object. Function name and arguments are extracted and the function is executed, if possible. We already talked about generating structured output before. Here, we will use it to generate a function call. 


#### Function definition

The first step in using function calling is to define the functions that the LLM can call. This is done by providing a JSON schema that describes the name of the function, its arguments and their types. The JSON schema should be provided to the LLM in the system prompt. Here is an example: ^[Note, that this is not an executable implementation but just a description of the function for the LLM.]


    {
        "name": "get_current_weather",  
        "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",  
        "arguments": {    
            "location": {"type": "string"},    
            "unit": {"type": "string"}  
            } 
    }

Function name and description should be as clear as possible to make it easier for the LLM to decide which function to use and how to properly use it. Argument names and types should be as precise as possible to avoid ambiguity in the function call.


#### Prompting

The second step is to provide a good prompt. The prompt should make it clear to the LLM to only generate valid output and that it should follow the JSON schema. Here is an example of a prompt that can be used for function calling:

    You are a helpful assistant that generates function calls based on user input. Only use the functions you have been provided with.

    {function definition as described above}

    User: What's the weather like in Berlin?

    Assistant: {
        "name": "get_current_weather",
        "arguments": {"location": "Berlin", "unit": "celsius"}
    }

Another way of forcing the LLM to output structured format is to use ``pydantic`` classes as described last time. 

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Task

Try it!

1. Open a notebook and connect to a local LLM using LM Studio.
2. Define the function `get_current_weather` as shown above.
3. Write a prompt that asks the LLM to generate a function call based on user input. Use prompt engineering as shown above or pydantic classes as shown last time. 
4. Test the prompt with an example input.
5. Define other functions and try other inputs and see if the LLM generates valid output.

:::

#### Challenges, finetuned models and the influence of size

The main challenge is here to get the LLM to generate a valid answer. This is not always easy, as LLMs are not usually super safe coders 😃.

- They can hallucinate functions or arguments that do not exist.
- They can forget to call a function.
- They can forget to provide all required arguments.
- They can provide the wrong type for an argument.
- They can provide invalid values for an argument.

There are several strategies to mitigate these issues:

1. **Prompt engineering**: A good prompt can help to guide the LLM towards generating valid output. This is especially true for larger models, as they have a better understanding of the world and can therefore generate more accurate responses.
2. **Finetuning**: Finetuning a model on a specific task can improve its performance on that task. This is especially useful for smaller models, as they are less likely to hallucinate functions or arguments that do not exist.
3. **Size**: Larger models are better at generating valid output than smaller models. However, larger models are also more expensive to run and require more computational resources.

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Task

Test it! (we can do it together, if your hardware does not allow you to run the model.)

As above, but this time

<!--  update models -->

1. use a very small model (e.g [a small Llama model](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF))
2. use a model finetuned for the task (you could try [this one](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/llama-3-8B-function-calling-GGUF))
3. a larger model ([a larger llama in this case](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF))

### Code Generation

<!-- smolagents as example (more on agents later), or not... Just try it using LLM call-->

The exception mentioned above is the [smolagents framework](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index). Here, the default mode is code generation, but JSON mode is also supported. (We will talk more about agents and the smolagents framework soon.) When using this approach, the function definition and description will be given to the LLM as python code. Additionally, the LLM is expected to generate the function call also as valid python code. As with structured output, function name and description should be as clear as possible. Typing might also help. 

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Task

Try it!

1. In your notebook, define the weather function (and/or some other function of your choice) in python code. 
2. Write an appropriate prompt that makes it clear that you expect python code calling the defined function(s). 
3. Test your prompt with an example input.


:::

As mentioned above (several times already), giving clear names and descriptions for functions, parameters, etc., will help the model generate more accurate code snippets. (PRO TIP: it will help your human coworkers as well in understanding your code.) Here, you have the opportunity to see the consequences in action in a save environment without angering fellow humans or yourself later on!


::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Task

Try it!

1. In your notebook, write a well written python function using clear names, description text and typing hints. You can use the one you wrote earlier, because of course you wrote clean code!
2. Test the function with your prompt and example inputs. 
3. Now write a badly written python function, without clear names, descriptions or typing hints. Test it with your example inputs too. Are the results better or worse? Why do you think that's happening?
4. Upload your notebook to Moodle.

## Agents recap

We introduced agents already back in chapter 3. To give a quick recap, an agent is a wrapper layer, that takes the user input and pipes it to an LLM, together with a custom system prompt, that allows the LLM to answer the user request better. The agent has several modules at its disposal, the memory, some tools and a planning tool. 

The memory function is what allows chat models to retain a memory of the past conversation with the user. This information is saved as plain text in the memory and given to the planning module (i.e. the LLM) along with the system prompt and the current user input. 

The planning module then decides which tools to use, if any, to answer the user request. The output of the planning module is a response message containing one or several tool calls (or a final answer). The agent then executes the tool calls by first parsing the response, then executing the functions. Based on the tool outputs, a final answer is generated and sent back to the user.


### React agents

There a several types of agent. Now, we want to fucus on the ReAct agent introduced by [@yaoReActSynergizingReasoning2023]. The ReAct agent is a type of agent that uses the ReAct framework to solve complex tasks by reasoning in multiple steps. It is based on the idea of "thought-action-observation" loops. The LLM is given a task and it generates a thought, which is then used to decide on an action. The action is executed and the observation is fed back into the LLM. This process is repeated until the LLM decides that it has enough information to answer the question or if the maximum number of iterations is reached.


### Llamaindex

LLamaindex is a framework that  makes it easy to implement and use agents. In Llamaindex an agent consists a an *agent runner* and an *agent_worker*. Think of the agent runner as the agent core in the architecture schematics and the agent worker as the planning module. The tools are functions implemented in python that can be executed by the agent worker. Finally, the memory module consists of a simple text buffer, logging the conversation history between the user and the agent and between the agent and the tools.


::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Task

Let's have a look!

1. Open a notebook and connect it with a local LLM using LM Studio.
2. Define a function that can be called by the agent to get the current weather in a given location. (Implement it this time, it doesn't need to work, just return random weather)
3. Initialize a ReAct agent using LLamaindex (you can use [this tutorial](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/react_agent/) as the starting point)
<!-- (we will use [this example](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/agent_runner/agent_runner/) as a starting point, since it reimplements the function calling agent and returns a step-by step breakdown of its thought process). 
4. Have a look at the prompt, the agent gives to the LLM (you can find it using `agent.get_prompts()`)
5. Discuss the prompt with the group! What does it do? How does it do it?
6. Ask the agent to tell you the weather in a given location.
7. Watch in LM Studio how the LLM called by the agent creates the thought process, function calls and the final response.
8. Try to break the agent by asking stuff it cannot answer. Be creative. (On one occasion I just said "Hi" and it went into an infinite loop because it did not need a tool for that and there wasn't a "none" tool 😜.)
9. Upload to Moodle
