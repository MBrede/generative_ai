# Organizational Details

## Planned Class Structure

Each class meeting will follow this structure:

1. **Instructional Session**: We'll introduce new concepts and techniques.
2. **Practice Exercise**: Students will apply these concepts through an exercise.
3. **Project Worktime**: Students will work on their team projects.

Students will be divided into teams of three at the start of the course, with projects culminating in a final presentation to the class. The project grade will count towards your final course grade.
