# Agent basics

<!-- ## Fundamentals of agents and train-of-thought prompting -->

## What is an agent? 

"An AI agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application." [@WhatAIAgent2024]

An agent (from latin *agere*, to act) is defined by its ability to make decisions based on the circumstances to achieve a predefined goal. In the context of large language models, agents are LLM-based systems where the control flow of an application is decided by the LLM based on its understanding of the situation at hand. Often, it also means that the agent has access to the external world i.e. it has **agency**. In Practice, this means that the LLM decides what do do next, which tool to use (if any), which information to retrieve, etc. based on its understanding of the situation. A nice Example of such an *agentic* system is *Vending-Bench* [@backlundVendingBenchBenchmarkLongTerm2025], where an AI agent is tasked with managing a vending machine. The agent is responsible for deciding what products to stock, when to restock, which prices to set, etc. based on its understanding of the market demand, competition, and other factors.

<!-- In the context of large language models, agents are LLM-based systems that can solve complex tasks. Imagine asking a question like:  -->

But let's keep it simpler for now. Let's say you want to know:

__"What were the key learnings from the Generative AI elective module in SoSe 25 at FH Kiel?"__

Could you just ask an LLM that question and expect a correct answer? 

As stated earlier, it is in theory possible, but in reality usually not. So we need a more complex approach. 

<!-- It is in theory possible, that an LLM could answer that directly, but only if it was trained on this information, that is, if a text describing the module exists, is accessible from the web and was used in training the model. However, usually we can not expect the LLM to have this knowledge.  -->

Let's think for a moment how a human would answer that (one that did not attend the module). We would probably try to get a copy of the script, maybe we saved the script to our hard drive or other data storage. Maybe we could search the web for a description or text version of the module. Having obtained a copy of the script, we would probably read it. Then, we would try to distill the information hidden therein, to answer the question. 

So, for our LLM to answer that question, it needs to be able to perform several tasks:

- Searching the web or a local file storage for relevant documents
- Reading and understanding a document
- Summarizing the content of a document
- Answering questions based on the summary of a document

This is where agents come into play. Agents are LLM-based systems that can solve complex tasks by performing several subtasks in sequence, using an LLM to decide which subtask to perform next. In our example, the agent would first search the web for relevant documents, then read and understand them, summarize them and finally answer the question based on the summary.


## Agent framework

![Architecture of the agent framework [@LLMAgentsNextra2024]](../imgs/agent-framework.png)

To facilitate this, an agent system consists of several components:

- **Agent**: the agent core acting as coordinator
- **Planning**: Assists the agent in breaking down the complex task into subtasks
- **Tools**: functions that the agent can use to perform a specific task
- **Memory**: used to store information about previous interactions with the agent

We will describe each of them below. 


### Agent

This is a general-purpose LLM, that functions as the brain and main decision-making component of an agent. It determines which tools to use and how to combine their results to solve complex tasks. The agent core uses the output of the previous tool as input for the next tool. It also uses an LLM to decide when to stop using tools and return a final answer. The behavior of the agent and the tools, it has at its disposal, is defined by a prompt template.


### Planning

Planning is the process of breaking down a complex task into subtasks and deciding which tools to use for each subtask. The planning module is not easily separable from the agent core. It is more like the setup that defines how the LLM should approach the problem (e.g. multi-step thought process), rather than an independent component. 



<!-- usually also an LLM, it can be one fine-tuned to this specific task or receive a specialized prompt. It uses techniques like __chain-of-thought__ (CoT) prompting to generate a plan of action [@weiChainofThoughtPromptingElicits2023]. CoT prompting is a technique that encourages the model to explain its reasoning step by step, making it easier for us to understand and evaluate its answers. Other strategies include __Tree-of-Thoughts__ [@longLargeLanguageModel2023], [@yaoTreeThoughtsDeliberate2023], [@hulbertUsingTreeThoughtPrompting2023] or __ReAct__ [@yaoReActSynergizingReasoning2023]. -->
 <!-- and __Reflexion__ [@shinnReflexionLanguageAgents2023].  -->
<!-- We will discuss these in more detail later. -->


### Tools

Tools are functions that the agent can use to perform a specific task. They can be pre-defined or dynamically generated based on the user's needs. Tools can be simple, such as a calculator, or complex, such as a web search engine. Tools can also be other agents, allowing for the creation of multi-agent systems. In our example, the tools would be a web search engine and a document reader. Other popular tools are a data store or a python interpreter. 


### Memory

Memory is used to store information about previous interactions with the agent. This allows the agent to remember past conversations and use this information in future interactions. Memory can be short-term, such as a conversation buffer, or long-term, such as a database. Memory can also be used to store the results of previous tool uses, allowing the agent to reuse them if necessary.


<!-- ### Chain-of-Thought prompting

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting refers to the technique of giving the LLM hints in the user input on how to solve the problem step by step, similar to what we did above. In the original paper, this was used with few-shot prompting (giving the LLM examples in the prompt), see figure below. But it is also possible to use it with zero-shot prompting (i.e. without examples) by invoking the magical words "Let's think step by step" [@kojimaLargeLanguageModels2023a]^[Note that these informations get old *fast*. Newer LLMs may have this functionality build in already]. 

![Chain-of-Thought prompting illustrated [@weiChainofThoughtPromptingElicits2023]](../imgs/chain_of_thought.png)


### Tree of Thoughts

Tree of Thoughts (ToT) is a generalization on CoT prompting. The papers on ToT are somewhat complex, so we will not discuss them in detail here. In short, LLMs are used to generate thoughts, that serve as intermediate steps towards the solution. The difference to CoT is basically, that several thoughts are generated at each step, creating a tree-like structure. This tree is then searched using breadth-first search or depth-first search until a solution is found. A simplified example is given by [@hulbertUsingTreeThoughtPrompting2023]: 

    Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
    All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
    then share it with the group.
    Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
    If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
    The question is... -->


### Multi-step agents

The *de-facto* standard for multi-step agents is ReAct introduced by Yao et al. [@yaoReActSynergizingReasoning2023]. ReAct is short for Synergizing Reasoning and Acting. In this approach, the agent updates its reasoning after each step of tool use. Basically, it is running a while loop: 

First, the agent is initialized with a system prompt, tools and a task to solve. Then it goes through these steps:

1.  The agent reasons about the task and selects a tool to use based on its reasoning.
2.  The tool is executed. Both the tool usage and the result are recorded to memory.
3.  Based on the output from the tool, the agent updates its reasoning and may select another tool if needed.
4. **Repeat** until the goal is achieved or deemed unachievable.
5. The final answer is generated based on the memory.

Or, in code structure (from [the smolagents site](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents)):

    memory = [user_defined_task]
    while llm_should_continue(memory): # this loop is the multi-step part
        action = llm_get_next_action(memory) # this is the tool-calling part
        observations = execute_action(action)
        memory += [action, observations] # this is the memory update part
    return llm_generate_answer(memory) # this is the final answer generation part



<!-- ReAct (short for Synergizing Reasoning and Acting) is a technique based on CoT, that updates its reasoning after each step of tool use. This allows the agent to react (pun intended) to unforeseen results during the step-by-step solution i.e. failed tool use. The agent can then follow a different chain of thoughts. This makes it very well suited to tool use. An illustration is given in the figure below.  -->

## Examples of agent-frameworks 

There are *a lot* of agent frameworks out there. In this module we will focus on two of them: LlamaIndex and smolagents. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they all share the same basic architecture as described above. We will describe each of them below.

 - [Llamaindex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index): LlamaIndex is a data framework for building LLM applications. LLamaindex is easy to use out of the box. The documentation consists mainly of examples and tutorials that guide the user through the process of building an agent application. These can of course be combined or varied in many ways to create more complex applications.
 - [smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index): Smolagents is an agent framework for LLMs developed by the huggingface team. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Smolagents is quite new but the documentation is quite good and the community is very active. 

 We will also give honorary mentions to two other frameworks, which are also very popular in the LLM community.
 - [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain): LangChain is a popular framework. It is designed to be modular and easy to use. It is designed for developers who want to build applications with LLMs but do not necessarily have a lot of time to spend on building the infrastructure. 
 - [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack): Haystack is an open source NLP framework that enables you to build production-ready applications around LLMs and other models. The company behind Haystack, Deepset, is based in Germany and has a strong focus on open source. It is a good choice for production environments where you need high performance and scalability.

 <!-- - [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen): AutoGen is an open source framework for developing large language model (LLM) applications using multiple LLMs that can collaborate with each other. It enables the development of multi-agent systems, where each agent has a specific role and can communicate with other agents to solve complex tasks. -->
