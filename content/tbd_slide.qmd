# Additional content (tbd)

In last years course, we covered mostly GANs here. However, while they are a lot of fun, they appear to be mostly obsolete now. I am thinking of preparing a different lecture instead. For this, I want to hear your opinion. There are basically three options:

- **Generative Advisary Networks (GANs):** As mentioned, GANs are mostly obsolete now, but are an interesting and fun approach.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** An open protocol by Anthropic for function calling. This should make integrating of function calling easier for LLM-based applications. 
- **Automatic data analysis:** Use LLMs to first generate a hypothesis about a data set, then to decide on which analysis-steps are to be taken to test it and finally to generate pandas calls to test it.
