## Basics of using Open Source AI image generation models

<!-- - AUTOMATIC1111 -->
<!-- TODO: comfyUI -->


<!-- 
motivation: use it easily and comfortably on local device comparable to ollama, lmstudio for LLMs. Tools for this include

- automatic1111's open web ui (not maintained anymore)
- comfy ui (sehr mächtig, low code)
- huggingface, see last session

task: 

- try one or more of these tools
- try generation parameters (maybe with more input from lecturer? mention them before in main text. or make this a second task. )
- try loading another img gen model


We want API mode, explain API mode, basically call from python

task: if using some ui (not on hugging face) try api mode

 -->


One of the challenges of using image generation models is the required computational power and the fine-tuning effort needed to obtain high quality images. This can be a significant barrier for individuals or smaller organizations that may not have access to large computing resources. 
It is, therefore, good to have access to pre-trained image generation models. Today, we want to focus on using image generation models locally and how to integrate them into pipelines. 

For large language models, we used mainly LM Studio to run the models on our laptops. Image generation models, however, do not run in LM Studio as of 2025. Additionally, there is no real equivalent for image generation models. There is, however, a tool that makes running image generation models locally more convenient: [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). 
 
 <!-- Let us use this tool to see how we can run an AI image generator on our laptops, using the open source model [SDXL Base 1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0) from StabilityAI. This is a very short summary of the features of AUTOMATIC1111's web UI, which we will use in this article for running an AI image generator on our laptops:   -->

::: {.callout-note}

## 📝 Task 

Let's have a look!

 - Install AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion web UI on your laptop using [these instructions](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui#installation-and-running).
- Start the server, open the webUI.
- Start generating images.🎉
- Change some of the settings and see what happens.
- What does the ``Sampling steps`` parameter do?
- Also check out the ``img2img`` function.

:::

This tool surely does make image generation more convenient. Most of the time, however, we do not want to deal with a web UI, but with an API endpoint. Fortunately, A1111's webUI also has an API mode, which is quite easy to use and supports all features of the web UI (and some more).
We are mostly interested in the `txt2img`  API endpoint, which allows us to generate images from a text prompt. Let's have a look at how this works:

::: {.callout-note}

## 📝 Task 

- Open [the documentation](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/API) of the API.
- Run the web UI in API mode.
- in a notebook, run an example call to the ``txt2img`` endpoint.

We now know how to easily generate images using a local model. The next steps would be to try different models, and to add Lora (or other) adapters to them. 



## AI image generators in agent systems or pipelines

<!-- 
thoughts: first full pipeline and then motivate singe steps? or step by step motivation?

motivation: the project, include image gen in a agent system or pipeline. we want to generate illustrations for our text. so pipeline needs to work on generic text input, not specialized image prompts. pipeline:

- generic text block, e.g. generated, the text from text gen pipeline or other
- image prompt generation
- image generation
- quality assurance

how would we do it?

- example: just use some text and try to generate an image (either only gedankenexperiment, but better to try this, i.e. the corgi wikipedia header text or article summary)
- example: generate an image prompt first. is it better? should be (can only handle short descriptions based on its training, also text is not normally good image prompt)

 -->

In this section we want to explore the use of AI image generators as components in agent systems or LLM pipelines. An example for this might be a system that takes a few keywords, generates a text from it and then uses a language model to generate an image generation prompt based on this text. This prompt is used to generate an image. 
The final image is then sent to some quality assurance system to check if the output matches the input (or at least makes sense).

<!-- We covered agent systems extensively already. This time we want to focus on building a language model pipeline instead. In this section, we will: -->
So, we want to build a pipeline that

- generates or retrieves some text based on some input keywords.
- uses this text as context for generating an image generation prompt.
- generates an image from the prompt.
- does some kind of quality assurance by comparing the original text embedding with the generated image embedding. 

Note, that comparing the embeddings of the generated image with the input text may not be the best way of judging image quality. 

<!-- dont need this any more 
Most agent frameworks we already introduced support building pipelines in addition to agents. See for example [this tutorial](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/pipeline/query_pipeline/) on how to implement query pipelines in llamaindex or [this documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/pipelines) for pipelines in haystack. To get a full understanding of the basic principles, it is most educational to implement a pipeline from scratch.  -->


### Text generation or retrieval

<!-- 
motivate this better: in your project, you have this text gen pipeline. now you want to generate images that fit this portion of your text. it should generate an image illustrating this paragraph... 

so, the starting point is some generic text, not an actual img gen prompt or image caption. 

task: use your text gen pipeline, or some substitute, a short news article, a paragraph from a book, ...

 -->

The pipeline we are about to build starts with some input given by the user. In previous chapters we covered several ways of doing this. You could:

- use a local LLM to generate the text for you.
- use a retrieval function from a vector store or other text database (e.g. wikipedia API).
- combine both approaches in a RAG system.


::: {.callout-note}

## 📝 Task 

Let's get started!

- Open a notebook and implement a simple text generation or retrieval function.
- Get some text from an input. 

:::


### Image generation

The next step is to to generate an image that fits the text. While we could just send the full text to the image generator and let it do its thing, a better approach is to generate a special prompt for the image generator. This prompt is then used to generate the image. 

::: {.callout-note}

## 📝 Task 


- In your notebook, implement a call to an LLM that generates an image generation prompt from your text. 
- Also implement a call to an image generator. 
- Connect to an LLM (if not already done so) and to an image generation model. 
- Generate an image for your text. 

:::


### Quality assurance

<!-- 
motivation: images are not always great!

- we need QA
- we want it automated

ways of doing it:

- embedding based (semantic fit)
- photo quality rating, look online for open source tools
- other (factually correct?, most colorful, ... )
- a combination of the above

 -->

Now that we have the image, we want to assure that it fits the text. There are several ways of doing this. We could, for instance, evaluate text and images manually (or, rather, by eyeballing it). This works well for small amounts of images. However, it is not scalable for larger amounts. 

One way of automating the examination is to check if the image matches the text semantically, i.e. in meaning. One could translate the image back to text, using an image-to-text model. This description of the image can then be compared to the original text using embeddings and a suitable distance metric, e.g. cosine. Or we could embed both image and text using a multi-modal model and calculate the distance directly. In both cases, we need a predefined criterion, i.e. a fixed distance, that has to be reached to accept the image as good enough. Alternatively, we could generate several images and just chose the best matching one. 

::: {.callout-note}

## 📝 Task 

Let's have a look!

- In your notebook, implement a function that displays text and image for manual inspection. 
- Implement an automated similarity rater for text and images. You can use [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) for that task. 
- Think of another way to automate quality insurance on the generated images. 

:::


### Pipeline

<!-- 
see thoughts above
 -->

Finally, we can wrap everything in a pipeline. The pseudocode below shows the general principle. This is shown here for generating a number of images and picking the best matching one, but it can easily be converted to generate images until a predefined criterion is matched. 

    ## pseudocode
    def image_gen_pipeline(user_input):
        get_text(user_input) -> text
        generate_image_prompt(text) -> image_prompt
        for i in range 5:
            generate_image(image_prompt) -> image
            rate_image(image) -> rate_value
        find_best_rated_image(images, rate_values) -> best_image
        return best_image


::: {.callout-note}

## 📝 Task 

Let's finalize

- In your notebook, implement the pipeline outlined above. 
- Make a few test runs.
- Upload your notebook to Moodle.
