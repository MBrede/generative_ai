# LLM-based data analysis

## motivation

- talk to a dataset
- insight generation pipeline
- Problematisierung: Bezug zu einem Problem herstellen / motivierendes beispiel? als coding task

## theory

- grundlegende begriffe einführen

    - hypothesis
    - question (with regards to the dataset and in contrast to a hypothesis)
    - insight, what is an insight (see paper)
    - claim, insight can be broken into claims
    - correctness of insight
    - insightfulness of insight
    - Completeness of answer

- query agent
    - natural language to query
    - execution, basically call exec() on generated code (unsafe)
    - save execution
        - predefined list of tools, see agent session (limiting)
        - blacklist (limiting, unsafe)
        - LLM judge (unreliable)
        - sandboxing, virtual environment



## Pipeline-architektur

- high level overview (see paper)
- hypothesis generator (see last session)
- query agent 
- summarizer
- with example 


## hypothesis generator

- high-level-question (see last session)
- break high level questions into a set of low-level questions
- with coding task (implement this step)


## query agent

for every low level question:
- natural language to pandas
- **SAVE** execution
- result to natural language (answer)

- with coding task (implement this step)


## summarizer

- low-level answers to insight
- with coding task (implement this step)

## optional verifier

- difficult because no ground truth
- LLM-as-a-judge?
- with coding task
